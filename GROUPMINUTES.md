# IFB299-Project

Team Creation: 26/July/2017


Present Memebers:
Charles
Misha
Ashley

Fahd

Agenda: Create Group, assign titles/jobs, set up further meetings

What was achieved:

We created a facebook group for keeping in contact and a github for keeping our project together. We decided that team meetings would happen online over Facebook using the voice/video call function each weekend. Fahd was designated as the Client, Ashley was designated as the SCRUM-master, and Charles, Misha and Josh became the developers. The assignemnt was discussed briefly before the meeting ended, agreeing to all look it over more thoroughly before our next meeting.
